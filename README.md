## OVERVIEW
It is an open source project intended to provide the community, especially those in the health domain, a set of useful databases to build an ICD10 task classification. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is a system that classifies medical diagnoses and procedures, and is used globally to improve healthcare management, research, and decision-making.

The purpose of this project is to provide healthcare professionals and researchers with a comprehensive and standardized set of databases that can be used to build an ICD10 task classification. The databases include information on various diseases, medical procedures, and their corresponding codes, which can be used to classify health conditions and treatments.

This project is developed using Python programming language, and the databases are stored in a text file. The code is open source and available for anyone to use or contribute to. We encourage community participation to improve the quality of the databases and ensure that they are comprehensive and up-to-date.
